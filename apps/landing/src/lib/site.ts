    question: "What are Netflix genre codes?",
    answer:
      "Netflix groups titles into thousands of small categories, like Campy Zombie Movies or Feel-good Spy Movies. Each one has a number. Visiting netflix.com/browse/genre/ followed by that number opens the category directly, even if it never shows up on your home screen.",

    question: "Is this made by Netflix?",
    answer:
      "No. Categories for Netflix is an independent, open-source project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Netflix.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is a category empty or missing titles?",
    answer:
      "Netflix's catalog changes by country and over time, so a code that is full in one region can be empty in another. The extension does not unlock titles or change your region.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the extension have access to?",
    answer:
      "Only Chrome's storage permission, used to keep your favorites, hidden genres, recents, and theme in your browser. It does not read Netflix pages, cookies, your account, or your browsing history.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it cost anything?",
    answer:
      "No. It is free and licensed under GPLv3. The source code is on GitHub, and you can build the same package yourself.",
